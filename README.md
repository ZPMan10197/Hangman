# Hangman Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Hangman game to be played in the command line. The player guesses letters to try to figure out the hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by running `python3 hangman.py` in your command line interface.
2. One player enters a word for the other player to guess (or you can modify the code to randomly select a word from a predefined list).
3. The guessing player then inputs letters one at a time to try to figure out the word.
4. The game continues until either the word is guessed (win) or the hangman is fully drawn (lose).

## Features

- Text-based hangman drawing that updates with each incorrect guess.
- The ability for the player to enter the word to be guessed.
- Input validation to ensure guesses are valid characters.
- A running display of correctly guessed letters and remaining blank spaces in the word.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Customization

You can customize the game by:
- Changing the list of words in the `word_list` variable.
- Adjusting the number of allowed incorrect guesses.
- Implementing additional features like difficulty levels, timers, or score tracking.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Adding a GUI for a more interactive experience.
- Expanding the word database, possibly with different categories.
- Including multiplayer support over a network.
